This directory should contain two downloaded files from the mozilla deepspeech project, namely the pbmm file 
and the scorer file.
rename the files so that they are ds.pbmm, and ds.scorer, that way our code can find them without too much 
faf.

At moment of writing, the pbmm and scorer files are the v0.9.3 files.
