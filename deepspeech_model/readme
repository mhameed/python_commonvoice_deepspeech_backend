This directory should contain a directory for each user. Each user 
subdirectory should contain a directory for the language code of the 
model thats contained within it.

For example:

    Bob
    -> En
       -> ds.pbmm
       -> ds.scorer
    -> zh-CN
       -> ds.pbmm
       -> ds.scorer
    Fredrik
    -> Fr
       -> ds.pbmm
       -> ds.scorer

These are either the Mozilla pre-built models from:
https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech

or models exported from training.
